# mpv

MPV media player configuration files. Place them in `~/.config/mpv` for Linux, or `C:\users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\mpv\mpv.conf` for Windows 10.

To use the lua scripts for downloading subtitles in Windows 10 add the `subliminal` Windows path in the respective files, replacing backslashes (`\`) with slashes (`/`).
